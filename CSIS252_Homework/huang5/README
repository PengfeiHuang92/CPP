BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog5'. Type 'make clean' at the command prompt
   after bulding the program. It will clean all the .o files.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog5' at the command prompt after building the program.
   
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This program will ask the user to enter the Maximum
score from the keyboard, then it will ask user to enter
the test scores from the keyboard and read until the
sentinel value -1 is input.
    After that, it will print out all the test score with
the percentage and the grade.
    at the end of the program, is will show the Summary
information, such as Maximum score, the number of students
processed,high socre,low score, range of scores(high score
minus low score),average score, median score and standard
deviation of scores.)

PROGRAM INPUT
    All the input comes from the keyboard. At first, this program will ask
user to enter the Maximum score. Then, this program will aks user to enter the
test scores until the sentinel value -1 is entered. Input can be entered all on one line,
or separate lines, or a combination of the two.
   For example:
      56
      87
      94
      -1
   or  56 87 94 -1 

PROGRAM OUTPUT
     All output is written to the screen. The output will be showed such as:
         
Enter the maximum score: 100
Enter the test scores end it with -1: 11 22 55 98 41 -1
     Score     Percentage     Grade
        98          98.00         A
        55          55.00         F
        41          41.00         F
        22          22.00         F
        11          11.00         F
Summary...........
Maximum Score:             100
Number of students:          5
High score:                 98
Low Score:                  11
Range of scores:            87
Average Score:           45.40
Median Score:            41.00
Standard Deviation:      30.36

PROGRAM DESIGN
    This program stores all the test scores in an array. Then, by calling
different function to get the result as output it.

FILE INDEX
file             function           description
--------------   -----------------  ----------------------
main.cpp         main               main function
constants.h      declarations       declares contants
getAvg.cpp       getAvg             get the average form the array
getGrade.cpp     getGrade           return the test grade
getMed.cpp       getMed             return the medimum test score
getScore.cpp     getScore           return the percentage of the test score
getStandardDeviation.cpp  getStandardDeviation  return the Standard Deviation
                                                of the score array
outputScores.cpp outputScores       outpur the scores with their percentage and grade
outputSummary.cpp outputSummary     output the summary of the test score
sort.cpp         sorted             reorder the score array, form highest to lowest



PROGRAM TESTING

1)testing the Grade is match.
Enter the maximum score: 100
Enter the test scores end it with -1: 50 60 70 80 90 -1
     Score     Percentage     Grade
        90          90.00         A
        80          80.00         B
        70          70.00         C
        60          60.00         D
        50          50.00         F

2)testing the median score
when even numbers was entered.
Enter the maximum score: 100
Enter the test scores end it with -1: 50 60 66 70 -1

Median Score:            63.00 (match)

when odd numbers was entered.
Enter the maximum score: 100
Enter the test scores end it with -1: 50 60 70 -1

Median Score:            60.00 (match)



Bugs!

 1.  The all input must be numbers.
 2.  The test score must have at least one score.
 3.  All the numbers must be greater than 0.
 4.  All the test score must not be greater than the maximum.
 5.  The number of test scores must smaller or equal to 30.
