BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog6'. Type 'make clean' at the command prompt
   after bulding the program. It will clean all the .o files.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog6' at the command prompt after building the program.
   
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    This program will read the Maximum score, names and socres from the file,
after few functions, the result will be written into a testresult and testsummary files.
The Summary information, such as Maximum score, the number of students
processed,high socre,low score, range of scores(high score
minus low score,average score, median score and standard
deviation of scores. the testresult information will be the name score percentage and the grade)

PROGRAM INPUT

Read input from the data file "testscores". The first value read is the maximum test score and the remaining values are two line pairs of student name (consisting one entire line in the input file) and student test score. These are to be stored in parallel arrays. The number of student names and cooresponding test scores can vary and will be read until end of file. As discussed in class, be sure the data file testscores has an end of line character after the last line (you can ensure this by typing cat input from the command line). Following is an example testscores file.

PROGRAM OUTPUT
     a testresult file and a testsummary.
         


PROGRAM DESIGN
    This program stores all the test scores in an array. Then, by calling
different function to get the result as output it.

FILE INDEX
file             function           description
--------------   -----------------  ----------------------
main.cpp         main               main function
constants.h      declarations       declares contants
getAvg.cpp       getAvg             get the average form the array
getGrade.cpp     getGrade           return the test grade
getMed.cpp       getMed             return the medimum test score
getScore.cpp     getScore           return the percentage of the test score
getStandardDeviation.cpp  getStandardDeviation  return the Standard Deviation
                                                of the score array
outputScores.cpp outputScores       outpur the scores with their percentage and grade
outputSummary.cpp outputSummary     output the summary of the test score
sort.cpp         sorted             reorder the score array, form highest to lowest

the test result looks like that after i run the code.
Name                      Score       Pct          Grade     
------------------------  -----     ------         -----     
Polly Ester                400      100.00           A
Tad Pohl                   348       87.00           B
Rose Bush                  325       81.25           B
Earl E Riser               287       71.75           C
Bud Weiser                   9        2.25           F
an the testsummary looks like this:
Maximum Score:             400
Number of students:          5
High score:                400
Low Score:                   9
Range of scores:           391
Average Score:           273.8
Median Score:              325
Standard Deviation:    137.366


All the data math with the assinment



Bugs!

 1. When the score greate than 1000, the result will not line up in the function
 2. The first number must be the maximum score of the file.
 3. The testscores must be cotains the same order data, the first data should be the maximum, then the name and the test score on the next line.
 4. There must have a testscore file and it contains the valid data. It gives the
 wrong result and summary if there is not such a testscores file
